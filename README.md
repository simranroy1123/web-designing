The pandemic is by no means over, and startling findings from this new study warns us just why we must continue to be careful about the deadly virus!



If you thought the only way for you to catch SARS-COV-2 is when respiratory droplets are transmitted via direct contact or air, think again. Even a simple act like talking to someone can transmit the virus just as much!By far, from what is known so far, the most common ways for COVID-19 to spread from one person to another is by direct contact of droplets, aerosol transmission (where droplets can linger or deposit on surfaces) or by talking.


However, thereâ€™s a difference between the type of contagious droplets generated when a person speaks or coughs. Talking, or breathing, for example, generate a lot of small-sized droplets which can travel for longer, and be more contagious, making talking and speech a riskier activity than coughing.
